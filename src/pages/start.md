# getting started!!!

welcome! heres the guide :D

feel free to ask in [#magazine](https://hackclub.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C0A8CMWM0CR) at any point if you have questions!

### step 0: project requirements

your project must be:

- not designed by ai, contains no ai art / text
- something unique - no tutorial projects (ie: average hackpad will be rejected)
- if it is hardware, it must be physically working (and have a demo video)
- strong preference for the basic demo to not require logging in
- MAKE SURE IT IS SHIPPED!!!! (ie: it entirely works, the design is polished, the repo is polished)

these types of projects will be rejected:

- projects that feel low effort (it should be something you are proud of!)
- projects that only exist within themselves (ie: a website with just basic facts on climate change)
- projects that are advertisement (ie: a site for your school / hackathon / club, and most personal sites)
- most static sites will probably be rejected if they only exist to give information (ie: blogs)

additionally:

- you must be 18 or younger at the time of shipping the project

### step 1: submit your project!

try to do this as soon as possible!

make a post in [#magazine](https://hackclub.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C0A8CMWM0CR) with:

- project name
- project description
- repo link (make sure your repo is polished! write a good readme if you haven't already)
- demo link
- screenshots (if software) / irl pictures (if hardware)
- what program/hackathon it was originally made for (if applicable)
- approx how long you spent on it!

you are free to request a number of pages; however it will be highly dependent on project quality / design / polish. generally:

- simple projects (ie: hackpad) - 1/4th page (typically 5-10h)
- mid sized projects (ie: keyboard, rp2040 devboard) - 1/2th page (typically ~20h)
- large projects (ie: polished game that took 50+ hours) - 1 page (typically 30h+)
- advanced projects (ie: [icepi sbc](https://github.com/cheyao/icepi-sbc), cnc mill) - 2 pages (very technical projects, but project design is also considered)

on average, most projects will probably be assigned the mid projects tier. projects will be given more or less space depending on their polish, and the author's ability to design a magazine page.

if you have multiple projects, please ship them all in the same post - you will be able to give you a multiple attached pages for you to design with if so!

### step 2: design your page!

use figma! this way, organizers can directly edit elements of your page and make last minute changes if necessary.

never used figma before? [download here!](https://www.figma.com/) also, [tutorial here!](https://anchor.hackclub.com/) made by yours truly :)
