# getting started!!!

welcome! heres the guide :D

feel free to ask in #magazine at any point if you have questions!

### step 0: project requirements

fdjsklfds

- not designed/made by ai
- something unique (especially if it comes from a beginner ysws - ie: average hackpad will be rejected)
- if it is hardware, it must be physically working (and have a demo video)

### step 1: submit your project!

try to do this as soon as possible!

make a post in #magazine with:

- project name
- project description
- repo
- demo link
- screenshots (if software) / irl pictures (if hardware)
- what program/hackathon it was originally made for (if applicable) 

you are free to request a number of pages; however it will be highly dependent on project quality / design. generally:

- simple projects (ie: solder pcb, page personal site) - 1/4th page (typically 5-10h projects)
- mid projects (ie: hackpad) - 1/2th page (typically ~20h projects)
- complex projects (ie: ) - 1 page (typically 25h+ projects)
- advanced projects (ie: icepi sbc) - 2 pages (very technical projects, but project design is also considered)

on average, most projects will probably be assigned the mid projects tier. 

if you have multiple projects, please ship them all in the same post - you will be able to give you a multiple attached pages for you to design with if so!
